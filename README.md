Port scanning with Javascript

The index.html shows how it can be used.
Further notes about the implementation can be
found in portscanner.js (use the source, Luke).

The portscanning function is taken from
http://www.gnucitizen.org/blog/javascript-port-scanner/
written by Petko Petkov.

It needs jquery.

See the portscanner in action at
